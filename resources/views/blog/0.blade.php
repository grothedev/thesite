                <p>Hello. Welcome to my brain. This series of posts is meant to serve as an expression of a subset of my thoughts. This set of thoughts contains observations of the world which surrounds me; attempts to articulate truth; my convictions, beliefs, intentions, and goals as a human; random artistic works; and other thoughts which i think should be made public to any mind which might stumble upon this repository. It's basically just a blog. </p>
                <p>Over the past several years, I have accumulated many writings in my journal. I intend to sift through those and post the good stuff, with refinements when necessary. I will provide dates with those when possible. I've meant to do this for a while, but had never gotten around to it. And every time I would attempt to start it, I would quickly become overwhelmed with all the possible directions the words could go, not to mention the already existing volume of unorganized previous writings. It seems like a good practice to implement, to improve writing and critical thinking skills. And hey, why not? From an evolutionary perspective, it actually seems like the most sensible thing to do. I'm a guy with a computer, an internet connection, and a brain. Why wouldn't I want to emit my model of the universe into the global mind which now permeates the planet? It seems that by doing this, the main result would simply be further epistomological coherence among the humans with whom I share this world. If you've been on Facebook or looked at popular news sources, you would be forced to believe that the human species has lost any sense of rationality -- maybe we have. I will also post links to other interesting/useful resources and blogs. </p>
                <p>it certainly seems like we're entering into interesting times: global virus pandemic, violent displays expressing frustration with social institutions, satellite internet, a president sabotoging the mailing system, continued disregard for health of ecosystems. i don't know everything. i don't know which sequence of actions would lead to the best possible outcome, and i don't know what "the best outcome" is. but i feel that there might be a lack of a drive for "sense making". i fear that we might have come to take things for granted a little too much, and may be losing some of our capacity to establish a consensus on what's happening and what we should do about it. the quarantine certainly does not help. but it has provided an opportunity supposedly things are pretty shitty for a lot of people right now. i happen to have it pretty good; i still have a job, a strong immune system, and access to abundant food. however, i am aware that the systems we currently have in place but i can see that the activites of daily human conduct are not in accordance with what would logically follow if it was assumed that the goal is to establish the most ideal situation. 
				one problem is that we've been trained to assume that society works in a certain way, and we can about and do what we want to do on an individual level as long as we have money to afford it. we don't have to worry about the logistics of the material infrastructure because that's already been taken care of by other smarter people before us. but we are now begin to see that infrastructure become less dependable. i hope that we do not forget what technology should be for. we need to reconnect with nature, or rather, establish a harmonious relationship with it. one that ebbs and flows in a way that doesn't agitate any being.

				<p>Something that i was thinking about is how the covid pandemic is going to affect young kids. when i was hiking the other day, i walked past a family with three or four young children. as i approached, the mom told the kids to put on their masks. as one of the kids complained in helpless desparation, "i don't waaaaannaa!", i could see that they've gotten used to the process of turning away from strangers and looking down, in defense against "the virus". i am concerned that there may be negative psychological effects on an entire generation of kids. they are being born into a society where they are taught to keep distance between themselves and others and to put on a mask when around other people. they are taught to fear human interaction by default. they don't get to see the variety of facial expressions. </p>
				<p>I suppose it would be a good idea to give some context to where I'm coming from with these posts. I'll just give a brief update on my life to end this post, then the next post will be more based off of some previous writings. I've been working and saving money since January. In my free time I've been playing video games, practicing piano and sticking, playing djembe, reading, programming, exercising, hiking. I went to an open mic a few times before the pandemic happened. I test drove two vans so far. I'm trying to decide if I want to get a van or a Subaru forester/ascent. I want something that I can sleep in, for travel.

					the purpose of this website is to analyze what i am as a thing. i am truly overwhelmed by what i have at my disposal.
