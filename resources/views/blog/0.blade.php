                <p>Hello world. Welcome to the as-of-yet untitled repository of my thoughts and ramblings. Here you will find mostly observations, attempts to articulate what i believe to be true, my convictions and intentions, or random artistic works. </p>
				<p>Over the past several years, i have accumulated many writings in my journal which I believe to hold some value, or at least spark some thought or discussion. I intend to sift through them and post what is worth sharing. While I have a brain, a computer, an internet connection, and a 9 to 5 job for the time being, I might as well emit my model of the universe into this global mind which now permeates the planet, especially during this time of somewhat of a cultural break-down. One of my good friends has a saying, “When we remain silent, we appear to consent.” There are too many interesting and important things going on and too many ways to potentially make the world a better place to remain silent about it. </p>
				<p>This first post won’t be that long because I just want to get something out there. I’m back in Virginia after hanging in South Carolina for a month, with a new software engineering job and moved into a single bedroom apartment, which is within walking distance from work. I have the fastest internet I’ve ever had, so I’m excited to host servers and see what else I can do with that. I am currently hosting a modded minecraft (MC Eternal) server that some friends and I have been playing on. </p>
				<p>The band I’m in, Portal, is finally releasing its 2nd album on December 21st, which happens to coincide with the day that saturn and jupiter will reach their conjunction. If you don’t know about this significant astronomical event, <a href="https://www.space.com/jupiter-saturn-great-conjunction-2020">read about it here</a>. We did not plan that. I wish I could’ve spent more time to record better drum parts, but I had about 6 days last December to record the the entire album before moving from Iowa to Virginia. So I consider the album an EP. The guitar parts ended up being way more polished than the drum parts. I’m excited for it though; it still sounds pretty awesome I think. </p>
				<p>Here are some topics that I’ve written/thought about and which I will cover in subsequent posts:
					<ul style = "margin-left: 5rem;">
						<li>cognition, perception, conscoiusness, intelligence</li>
						<li>physics, information, evolution, art</li>
						<li>“alternative” medicine (ayurveda, herbology, yoga)</li>
						<li>climate change, ecology, natural patterns like domination vs acceptance, taking vs giving, masculine vs feminine, etc.</li>
						<li>culture, power, time, attention</li>
						<li>depth psychology</li>
						<li>random technical things like energy systems, resource management, artifical intelligence</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
                                <p>Here are some piano parts I recorded the past half-year. I have a bad habit of having a good idea for a song then recording some of it then forgetting to touch it again. Feel free to download these tracks, play along, or contact me for further collaboration.
                                    <audio controls src="http://108.28.164.96/f/sample5.9.ogg"></audio><br><br>
                                    <audio controls src="http://108.28.164.96/f/panic-piano.ogg">< /audio>
                                </p>
				<p>So with that all out of the way, my next post which I’ve already written most of will be about the  existential threat that we’ve been living with for the past few decades that most people are unable to take seriously. How did it get this way? Will technology save us? How can we actually begin to implement the decentralized and harmonious-in-all-domains method of governance which the intelligent-among-us have dreamed of? </p>
