concerning star-link / amazon-net situation:

	engineers who are up with jeff bezos and elon musk, i call upon you to step into your authenticity. play your role as a serious inventor who only has the best of intentions for humanity. realize what's at stake. get your mind out of the mud that is the paradigm of economic competition. who really has the authority here at these levels of planetary information networks? spacex and amazon (or, rather, engineers who might happen to work for those companies) should join forces to design the best satellite internet for the planet. the only thing that could come between that endeavor is only selflishness, a trait which we DON'T have to let rule us. we can empathize with super rich CEOs -- it's completely understandable that one would want to hold on to his wealth and power and continue the economic competition game. so let's understand that they are not perfect yogi masters who have become one with god, and recognize that all humans are imperfect.
