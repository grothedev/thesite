				<p>First off, I will apologize for the long delay in publishing the first actual post. Much of my cognitive energy gets drained from my job, and it’s hard to focus on articulating complicated ideas when it’s so tempting to just play video games, lift heavy objects while listening to metal, eat quesadillas, and sniff various essential oils. </p>

				<p>One of the problems to solve is maximal coordination. How can humans configure their daily activities such that they benefit each other the most? This would mean that everyone receives the resources and time that they want. [1]
From maximal coordination, we can distribute resources more efficiently with minimal waste and rate of entropy. We would end up implementing more sustainable agriculture practices, transportation practices, energy use patterns, etc. 
To achieve maximal coordination, there must be an incentive for people to behave in a certain way and participate in the society. But first there must be an incentive for some subset of the population to define the logistics of the new methodologies, and then to implement them. 
Any system composed of millions of instances of a certain type of object would want those members to coordinate with each other in the way that allows for the achievement of the goals of the system. Any system created by humans has a purpose – a function to perform within an environment. Looking at the energetic impact of our society, it appears to impose rectangular forms upon the surface of the planet to allow for efficient extraction of specific molecules, while returning this energy in the form of disorganized soundwaves, heat, various other electromagnetic waves, and other molecules mostly incompatible with the surrounding ecosystems. There are some mutually beneficial symbiotic relationships, however the net relationship is parasitic. This is obviously not a function any member of a system would be proud of. Currently, we act with our individual concerns decoupled from the concerns of the greater system, and alternate between acting as propellants of society and players of social games. With this, society can provide us with our base needs while we participate in creative activity and game-playing. Could it be that disregard or non-concernment of the functioning of our society[2] has lead to severely out-of-balance processes? No matter what form our social system takes, there will be processes that will need to be maintained. This means cognitive and physical effort imparted by its human members to keep things in order and running smoothly. This is mostly to maintain the insfrastructure of mass transportation of goods, energy, and waste, along with the communication networks required for coordination. 
We see that non-awareness – and then absense of concern – of the macro-effect of our daily conduct has lead us running towards the edge of a cliff when we have no wings. </p>

				<p>Presently, we have the means to communicate with each other instantly, and to be able to coordinate to such a high degree. I could send a message to all my neighboors in my apartment complex and tell them that I have just baked cookies to share. But there’s actually no way to do that right now. The internet applications we use right now are built around certain social contexts. The websites we used for our college courses were an attempt to get some coordination going. Remember BlackBoard, Canvas, or Moodle forum posts used for assignments or discussion on homework problems? This was a  community whose members existed close geographically and who had similar academic interests. It would make sense to tell all of them that you have baked cookies to share, because you could then meet in the department lounge room to eat them, and perhaps discuss something interesting. However, it wouldn’t make sense for me to announce that on my facebook, for all of my facebook friends are scattered across the world. [3] </p>
This is an important facet of the next version of society: how will things like resource management, social discourse, scientific research, engineering work, infrastructure maintenance, spiritual communion, and other rituals be handled in a maximally-coordinated system, and how will the responsibilities of each individual be decided? What will things like “work” and “the economy” look like? 

				<p>There is so much momentum in the current processes taking place. They direct our lives. They are what keep us getting up early each morning, driving to work, buying food at the grocery store, taking out our trash, paying our bills, and leaving us with no will or energy to change anything about it. And it’s even worse because of the covid pandemic; it’s more difficult to organize community coordination. It’s as if we are walking in parellel tunnels, unable to communicate. We see our friends through virtual translucent glass. In some sense, it is pretty ridiculous that we aren’t utilizing the ability of instantaneous global communication to figure out how to implement a better way of being[4]. I mean it is pretty fun to simulate huge battles with explosions and realistic physics and complicated strategies. Though how much action and change can we actually implement given the current circumstances? No one wants to get covid, obviously. 
The question remains: is it still possible to implement the necessary change before it’s too late? What is “too late” and what is “the necessary change”? The change is what we have to figure out. The temporal event that we believe is approaching and that we want to prevent has not been precisely defined by most people. Some say it is a configuration of environmental variables which would result in extinction of the human species. Most replace “extinction of the species” with “great suffering of many”, “scarce resource availability”, or “extreme decrease in biodiversity”. When these vague concepts are used, it’s impossible to quantify things, especially when we don’t even have all of the mathematical models in the first place. What amount of suffering will justify us to implement the changes? At least there are some people who have been working on figuring out what those changes should be in the meantime. </p>

				<p>To conclude, I just want to throw this chunk of thought out there. This is some of what I’ve been thinking about for the past several years. I feel like I could have a lot to say but I also want to be careful to not just be bullshitting and spewing out a bunch of words to keep pushing some narrative forward while I indulge in the spoils of society. I fear deeply for the future of humanity, for we appear to be holding something sacred here: consciousness, capacity for abstract thought and planning, an anti-entropic force. This sacred thing has been carried through time by all the species that came before us, and we may be at risk of squandering it and resetting millions of years of innovation on the phenomenon of self-organization. I don’t know what what happens to one’s perceptual experience after death, but I know that the molecules that facilitated their being will eventually come to facilitate the existence of some other organism(s). Given that, reincranation remains a plausible hypothesis. Therefore I think it advisable to tend to the well-being of future generations. </p>

					1. This also means that people know what they want, but we won’t delve into that in this essay<br>
					2. similar to denial of the psychological shadow <br>
					3.  sidenote: a few years ago I did bake cookies for everyone in my apartment building for halloween and it was well-received. More recently, I tried to leave some home-grown cooking herbs out for neighboors to take, but my roommate didn’t want me to. Now I live alone again so I will have to try again when covid has calmed down.<br>
					4. this isn’t entirely true; some people are doing it<br>

					Also, I noticed that when I am writing, random songs will pop into in my head. Here are some of the parts of songs that appeared while writing this:<br>
					<ul>
						<li>“is it only a dream that there’ll be no more turning away?” - pink floyd</li>
						<li>“Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got somethin' to say</li>
						<li>But nothin' comes out when they move their lips</li>
						<li>Just a bunch of gibberish” - eminem</li>
						<li>“we’re living in a land of make believe, and trying not to let it show” – moody blues</li>
						<li>“all we have to do is keep talking” – stephen hawking (from pink floyd – keep talking)</li>
						<li>“terror fills my soul” – gentle giant</li>
